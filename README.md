group microtask_assignments by task_id, then calculate duration for data for each group of tasks(manual - accuracy = 2 & auto - fraction = 1)
don't sum durations which are greater than 1.5 min or less than 0
in the end also include the task names of the task_id's which we initially grouped
(duration info can be found from output->data->duration' and score can be found on report -> '<parameter>'
